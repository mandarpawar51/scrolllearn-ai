# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ScrollLearn AI is a cross-platform Flutter mobile application that transforms learning into an interactive and engaging experience through gesture-based navigation and AI-powered study problems. The app allows users to access personalized educational content across multiple subjects (Math, Science, History, Geography) using intuitive swipe gestures, with AI-generated questions powered by configurable API providers like OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude through the open router api .

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Onboarding and Authentication

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to complete an onboarding process that allows me to select my preferred subjects and optionally authenticate, so that I can personalize my learning experience from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a subject selection screen with Math, Science, History, and Geography options
2. WHEN a user selects subjects during onboarding THEN the system SHALL save their preferences locally
3. WHEN a user completes subject selection THEN the system SHALL offer optional Google/Apple login
4. WHEN a user skips authentication THEN the system SHALL proceed to the gesture tutorial
5. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL display a gesture tutorial showing swipe directions for each subject
6. WHEN a user practices gestures in the tutorial THEN the system SHALL present subject-specific sample questions to demonstrate the learning experience

### Requirement 2: Interactive Tutorial with Subject Questions

**User Story:** As a new user learning the gesture system, I want to see sample questions for each subject when I practice the gestures in the gesture tutorial screen, so that I understand what type of content I'll get for each swipe direction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a downward swipe in the gesture tutorial screen practice mode THEN the system SHALL display a sample Math question (e.g., algebra, geometry, or arithmetic problem)
2. WHEN a user performs an upward swipe in the gesture tutorial screen practice mode THEN the system SHALL display a sample Science question (e.g., physics, chemistry, or biology concept)
3. WHEN a user performs a right swipe in the gesture tutorial screen practice mode THEN the system SHALL display a sample History question (e.g., historical events, dates, or figures)
4. WHEN a user performs a left swipe in the gesture tutorial screen practice mode THEN the system SHALL display a sample Geography question (e.g., countries, capitals, or landmarks)
5. WHEN a sample question is displayed in the gesture tutorial screen THEN the system SHALL show it for 3-5 seconds before allowing the next gesture
6. WHEN a user completes practice for all gesture directions in the gesture tutorial screen THEN the system SHALL mark the tutorial as complete
7. WHEN sample questions are shown in the gesture tutorial screen THEN the system SHALL use pre-defined questions that don't require API calls
8. WHEN the gesture tutorial screen is in practice mode THEN the system SHALL integrate question display seamlessly with the existing gesture detection and progress tracking

### Requirement 3: Gesture-Based Navigation System

**User Story:** As a student, I want to navigate between different subjects using intuitive gestures, so that I can quickly access the type of problems I want to practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes down vertically THEN the system SHALL generate and display a Math problem
2. WHEN a user swipes up vertically THEN the system SHALL generate and display a Science problem
3. WHEN a user swipes right horizontally THEN the system SHALL generate and display a History problem
4. WHEN a user swipes left horizontally THEN the system SHALL generate and display a Geography problem
5. WHEN a user performs a gesture for a subject not selected during onboarding THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the subject is not enabled
6. WHEN gesture recognition occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback within 200ms

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Problem Generation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to receive AI-generated study problems with solutions, so that I can practice and learn new concepts across different subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subject gesture is detected THEN the system SHALL call the configured AI API to generate a relevant problem
2. WHEN an AI API call is made THEN the system SHALL receive a response within 3 seconds
3. WHEN a problem is generated THEN the system SHALL display the question with multiple choice options or free input field
4. WHEN a user submits an answer THEN the system SHALL reveal the correct solution with explanation
5. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry option
6. WHEN no API key is configured THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to add API credentials

### Requirement 5: API Management and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my own AI API keys and select different providers, so that I can control my AI usage and access advanced models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display API management options for OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and other providers
2. WHEN a user adds an API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key format and store it securely
3. WHEN a user selects an AI provider THEN the system SHALL use that provider for subsequent problem generation
4. WHEN multiple API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL allow users to switch between providers
5. IF no API key is provided THEN the system SHALL use a default free tier or demo mode with limited functionality

### Requirement 6: Settings and Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my app experience through settings, so that I can adjust the difficulty, theme, and other preferences to match my learning needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display options for theme mode, difficulty level, and subject preferences
2. WHEN a user changes the theme THEN the system SHALL immediately apply light or dark mode throughout the app
3. WHEN a user adjusts difficulty level THEN the system SHALL generate problems appropriate to the selected difficulty
4. WHEN a user modifies subject preferences THEN the system SHALL update which subjects are available via gestures
5. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL persist the changes locally

### Requirement 7: Problem Interaction and Solution Display

**User Story:** As a student, I want to attempt problems and see detailed solutions, so that I can learn from both correct and incorrect answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a problem is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the question clearly with answer input options
2. WHEN a user selects a multiple choice answer THEN the system SHALL highlight the selection
3. WHEN a user submits a free text answer THEN the system SHALL accept the input
4. WHEN an answer is submitted THEN the system SHALL display whether it's correct or incorrect
5. WHEN the solution is revealed THEN the system SHALL show the correct answer with a detailed explanation
6. WHEN viewing a solution THEN the system SHALL provide an option to generate a new problem

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Performance

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to work smoothly on both Android and iOS devices, so that I can have a consistent learning experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL compile successfully for both Android and iOS platforms
2. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL load the home screen within 2 seconds
